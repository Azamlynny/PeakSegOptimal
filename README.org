PeakSegOptimal: Optimal Segmentation Subject to Up-Down Constraints

[[https://travis-ci.org/tdhock/coseg][https://travis-ci.org/tdhock/coseg.png?branch=master]] 

NOTE: the name of the package has been changed to PeakSegOptimal, to
avoid confusion with the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CoSeg/index.html][CoSeg]] package on CRAN (which is completely
unrelated to this package).

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tdhock/coseg")
#+END_SRC

** PeakSeg solvers

Linear time exact C++ solver for the optimal change points using the
Poisson loss and the PeakSeg constraint. 

*** PeakSeg Segment Neighborhood problem

There are two R functions that solve the Segment Neighborhood problem
(best models with at most 1,...,S segments). The constraints are first
segment mean <= second segment mean >= third segment mean, etc. For S
segments and N data points, complexity is O(S N log N) memory and
O(S N log N) time.
- PeakSegPDPA is a direct interface to the C++ code. Returns matrices
  for the optimal cost and number of intervals stored by the algorithm
  at each step. Input parameter is the maximum number of segments S,
  and outputs are the optimal models from 1 to S segments.
- PeakSegPDPAchrom is a more user-friendly interface, which takes a
  data.frame with columns chrom, chromStart, chromEnd, count as input,
  and returns data.frames as output. Input parameter is the maximum
  number of peaks P (implying S = P*2+1 segments), and outputs are the
  optimal models from 0 to P peaks.

*** PeakSeg Optimal Partitioning problem

There are two R functions that solve the Optimal Partitioning problem
(best model for a given penalty parameter). Input parameter is a
non-negative penalty constant (bigger for fewer peaks, smaller for
more peaks), and output is the model that minimizes the penalized cost
using the specified penalty constant. For N data points, complexity is
O(N log N) memory and time. The first segment mean is constrained
to be down (mu_1 <= mu_2), as is the last (mu_{N-1} >= mu_N).
- PeakSegFPOP is a direct interface to the C++ code. Returns matrices
  for the optimal cost and number of intervals stored by the algorithm
  at each step.
- PeakSegFPOPchrom is a more user-friendly interface, which takes a
  data.frame with columns chrom, chromStart, chromEnd, count as input,
  and returns data.frames as output.

*** Note about inequality constraints

Note that as defined in the [[http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/hocking15.html][PeakSeg ICML'15 paper]], the PeakSeg problem
has strict inequality constraints (segment mean 1 < segment mean 2 >
segment mean 3, etc). However, the solvers in this package use
non-strict inequality constraints (segment mean 1 <= segment mean 2 >=
segment mean 3, etc), and so may return a model with adjacent segment
means that are equal. In this case, the minimum of the PeakSeg problem
with strict inequality constraints is undefined. For example,

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  library(coseg)
  data.vec <- as.integer(c(1, 2, 3))
  fit <- PeakSegPDPA(data.vec, max.segments=3L)
#+END_SRC

For the data 1, 2, 3 the optimal model with at most 3 segments
actually has only 2 segments:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
> fit$mean.mat[3,]
[1] 1.0 2.5 2.5
#+END_SRC

This implies that the optimal model with strict inequality constraints
is undefined for these data. For example, the model with means 1, 3, 2
satisfies the strict inequality constraint, and has a PoissonLoss of

#+BEGIN_SRC 
> PoissonLoss(c(1,2,3), c(1,3,2))
[1] 1.723334
#+END_SRC

But that model is not optimal, because there is another model that
satisfies the strict inequality constraints, but has a better
cost. For example, 

#+BEGIN_SRC 
> PoissonLoss(c(1,2,3), c(1,2.9,2.1))
[1] 1.644766
#+END_SRC

But that model is not optimal, for the same reason (exercise for the
reader).

*** problem.* functions

If you want to use the [[file:R/problems.R][problem.* functions]] to perform optimal
segmentation and peak calling on the whole genome, please read the
[[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegFPOP][PeakSegFPOP tutorial]]. R is limited by memory, so it is better to use
the PeakSegFPOP command line program to compute optimal peak models
for large bedGraph files, since it stores the optimal cost in a
temporary file on disk (rather than in memory).

** Related work

An on-disk implementation of PeakSegFPOP is available as a [[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegFPOP][command
line program]].

| implementation | time       | memory     | disk       |
|----------------+------------+------------+------------|
| command line   | O(N log N) | O(log N)   | O(N log N) |
| R pkg coseg    | O(N log N) | O(N log N) | 0          |

Note that although both implementations are O(N log N) time complexity
for N data points, the command line program is slower due to disk
read/write overhead.
